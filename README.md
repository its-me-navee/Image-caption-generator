# Image Caption Generator
Developed an image caption generator using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) & Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Analysed, cleaned & simplified the text-data using Stemming and Lemmatization techniques so that patterns are easily identifiable
Utilized transfer learning by leveraging a pre-trained InceptionV3 model to effectively extract essential features from images
Utilized GloVe, an innovative unsupervised learning algorithm, to effectively generate dynamic word embeddings
